## About

The program uses dynamic binding to access one of many 
functions that are initialized as virtual in the dessert
base class and implemented differently in the derived 
classes. The dessert base class is an Abstract Base.

The data structure for this program is a 234 Tree. The
234 Tree supports insertion, display, and deletion.

There is error handling in the main hierarchy for 
errors involving bad user input. The main (client) 
program "main.cpp" catches the errors.
